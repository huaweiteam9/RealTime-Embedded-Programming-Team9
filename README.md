#  **Fruit and vegetable visual recognition system based on Raspberry Pi** 

## Project Overview
This is an intelligent refrigerator system that identifies food types and freshness through visual recognition, and records food storage time to optimize storage and reduce food waste.

---

## üìå INTRODUCTION
### **-Background** 
In our daily life,improper storage and forgotten food often cause uncertainty about consumption order, leading to spoilage and waste.So we came up with the idea of designing a smart refrigerator system to optimize storage and reduce food waste.

### **-Device**  
üí° **Based on Raspberry Pi 5 and requires an external camera.**

---

## üî• **Main function**
### ‚úÖ **Automatic identification of stored ingredients**
When the **refrigerator door opens**, the camera activates to detect existing and new food.
### ‚úÖ **Intelligent storage management**
The system **calculates shelf life** and displays food status, alerting users to expiring items.
### ‚úÖ **Efficient operation mode**
The **camera is activated** to detect only when the refrigerator door is opened, saving energy.

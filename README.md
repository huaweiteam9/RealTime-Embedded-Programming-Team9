## 📌 INTRODUCTION
### **Background** 
In our daily life,improper storage and forgotten food often cause uncertainty about consumption order, leading to spoilage and waste.So we came up with the idea of designing a smart refrigerator system to optimize storage and reduce food waste.

### **Device**  
💡 **Based on Raspberry Pi 5 and requires an external camera.**

---

## 🔥 **Main function**
### ✅ **Automatic identification of stored ingredients**
When the **refrigerator door opens**, the camera activates to detect existing and new food.
### ✅ **Intelligent storage management**
The system **calculates shelf life** and displays food status, alerting users to expiring items.
### ✅ **Efficient operation mode**
The **camera is activated** to detect only when the refrigerator door is opened, saving energy.

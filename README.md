Fruit and vegetable visual recognition system based on Raspberry Pi

This is an intelligent refrigerator system that identifies food types and freshness through visual recognition, and records food storage time to optimize storage and reduce food waste.

INTRODUCTION
Background:In our daily life,improper storage and forgotten food often cause uncertainty about consumption order, leading to spoilage and waste.So we came up with the idea of designing a smart refrigerator system to optimize storage and reduce food waste.

Device:Based on Raspberry Pi 5 and requires an external camera.

Main function:
-Automatic identification of stored ingredients
When the refrigerator door opens, the camera activates to detect existing and new food.
-Intelligent storage management
The system calculates shelf life and displays food status, alerting users to expiring items.
-Efficient operation mode
The camera is activated to detect only when the refrigerator door is opened, saving energy.
